## 🔹 Architectural Improvements
* **Refactored Controllers to Use Generic Repositories**: All CRUD operations in controllers no longer directly depend on Entity Framework Core.
Instead, controllers now utilize Generic Repositories, which handle database operations through a reusable, decoupled interface.

* **Benefits of Generic Repositories**:
Reduces repetitive code across multiple controllers.
Makes unit testing easier by allowing mock repositories instead of a real database.
Supports a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture for future development.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Backend**: **ASP.NET Core MVC** (C#)
* **Database**: Entity Framework Core (EF Core)
* **Authentication**: Session-based Authentication/Authorization (Utilizing `IHttpContextAccessor`)
* **Frontend**: Razor Views (`.cshtml`), **Bootstrap**
* **State Management**: Session Storage (for Shopping Cart: `mycart`)
* **Payment Gateway**: **PayPal Sandbox**
